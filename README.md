An unlogged user can browse alcoholic beverages and view their descriptions and reviews. However, attempting to access the profile, add a review, check the history, or visit the "posmakowane" section will result in a redirect to the login page.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 47 58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88c520ac-f6e5-4902-82c6-b49720d69ee3)

If the user does not have an account, clicking the "Zarejestruj się" button will redirect them to the registration page.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 18 14 18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247cb866-2ab2-4a96-b280-1b0091073e8e)

After logging in, the homepage is enhanced with a "Wyloguj" button and looks as follows.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 46 48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb050a6f-2073-49f6-8327-52fe365523cd)

On the homepage, filters are available that, when selected, display only the specified alcoholic beverages.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 47 04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c833edcf-f1f8-46db-a8da-149ac9719f9a)

When the user clicks on a specific alcoholic beverage, they will be directed to the alcohol's description, where they can read, among other things, the production year, the average user rating, and a detailed description of the beverage.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 01 02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5466f316-9024-4fec-93a0-2876aef83b35)

Below the alcohol description, user reviews are visible.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 01 27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c1cf92e-50d7-48c1-9900-4c627095ad76)

If the user has already written a review for the given alcoholic beverage, a text "Już wystawiłeś opinię dla tego produktu. Jeśli chcesz edytować przejdź do profilu." along with a redirect to the profile will appear in the top right corner of the reviews section, as shown in the screenshot above. If the user has not yet written a review, a "Dodaj opinię" button will appear, as shown below.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 44 33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e45af8c-86a0-4077-8de2-735862ada068)

After pressing the "Dodaj opinię" button, a window will appear for entering the review, which looks as follows:

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 44 49](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ded3bae0-e98c-4cb4-94ca-e4e609f404ec)

Returning to the homepage the first icon on the left in the top-left corner represents the history of consumed alcoholic beverages. Below is an example of a user's history.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 51 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d956a78-b87b-4bd8-9415-d8ee8edeef1c)

To add an alcoholic beverage to the history, press the "Dodaj do historii" button. 

The type of consumed alcoholic beverage can be entered manually or selected from a list. As the first letters are typed, the list updates dynamically, showing only beverages that start with the entered characters.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 50 02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aaac18f-af2d-4fdb-a2f7-15636187415c) ![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 18 30 58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f53def7-e3ba-49ac-bd2d-3c70e4276ee8)

Only after selecting a specific alcoholic beverage can the user enter its quantity and confirm the entry in the history.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 50 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bcc583-8f71-4d57-8230-373e78a84916)

Next to the history icon, there is a trophy icon representing achievements. There, the user can view all available achievements to unlock.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 47 22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108a4031-1ea9-457f-9f49-3bb5948cce5a)

In addition to the history, the user can also browse their "posmakowane" alcoholic beverages under the heart icon on the main screen. Only alcoholic beverages for which the user has marked the heart icon are displayed there, with the icon appearing in red. As seen in the example history, unmarked hearts remain black.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 53 19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2fbb0af-e87b-4e69-814f-b8cb8791696d)

After pressing the user icon in the top-right corner, the user is directed to their profile page, where they can find information about themselves, their achievements, a blood alcohol level calculated based on their history, and the reviews they have written.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 57 08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc70a75-ee3c-4fb9-b825-aa2ba8de0fd8)

The user also has the option to edit their profile by pressing the "Edytuj profil" button, which allows them to change their age and weight, and looks as follows:

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 57 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ae16da-8f37-4457-b9fb-e408aae84365)

In the "Opinie użytkownika" section, the user has the ability to edit each review.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 58 00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ef3d2d-bff8-4f58-8584-6aba76c1a6bb)

After pressing "Edytuj" an editing window will appear on the screen.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 16 58 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/739a710c-4bed-447a-97c6-50eb408b1cba)

As can be seen in the user's profile, their rank is displayed. There are three ranks available in the app: "Smakosz", "Degustator" and "Administrator". Below, the differences between the "Degustator" and "Administrator" ranks will be outlined.

For both "Degustator" and "Administrator", the homepage has an added "Dodaj alkohol" button above the filter section, as shown in the screenshot below.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 47 37](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891d3a11-a7da-4f80-9076-8ffd033c0b5c)

After pressing the button, a window appears on the screen where the user must fill in the details to add the alcoholic beverage to the database.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 47 47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706fedc8-8610-4313-8012-ff631206f08c)

And for "Degustator" this would be the end of the differences from the functions of a regular user with rank "Smakosz".

The administrator has a few additional functions. Some of them are available on the page with the details of the alcoholic beverages:

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 50 07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b3f1708-6165-4ee5-986b-32e71ae47999)

After pressing the red "Usuń alkohol" button, the alcoholic beverage is removed. However, after pressing "Edytuj alkohol"an editable field appears below the alcohol description, allowing modifications to its information, and it looks as follows:

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 50 41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f67bcb-94bc-4898-99bc-fd03428a78d9)

The admin can also delete other users' comments by clicking the "Delete" button next to a specific review.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 51 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adad4b56-253a-4789-bd7c-16e88d0d6758)

The "Administrator" profile also differs slightly. The admin has the ability to assign or change a user's rank.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 48 50](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05761003-f687-4d79-bde3-be1c3ff2b059)

After pressing the "Rangi użytkowników" button, a window like this will appear on the screen:

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 49 09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1357a577-a9cc-4315-b6f9-27bc38207909)

Admin must first select a specific user. They can do this by choosing from a list or by starting to type the username manually and then selecting from a narrowed-down list.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 49 27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f2eb6b5-ae13-49f6-b1b4-1d1f861f3feb)

After selecting a user, it's time to choose their rank.

![Zrzut ekranu 2025-03-31 o 17 49 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7ec8119-8eb1-4f25-837d-a510da4c4b9d)

In addition to their extra functions, both "Administrator" and "Degustator" have access to everything available to a basic user — "Smakosz".
